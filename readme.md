Please note that this content model has been superseded by Well Fluid Production content model. Please use that or the Fluid Flux Injection Disposal content models for future fluid production data.

This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for production from a geothermal well. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excel workbook documents a content model for exchange of information about fluid fluxes into or out of a geothermal well. A generic  model is intended to allow for oil, gas, or water fluid transfer. Oil and gas facilities may include of-shore platforms, whereas water facilities may include geothermal power plants. Because of the wide variety of possible flow measurements (commodities, aggregation type), the model adopts a thin approach, which may result in many records being returned for a single well. Thus most data about the well is linked through the HeaderURI instead of included inline to keep the redundant data volume down.
